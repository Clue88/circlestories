Added basic file structure for app routes; added a wrapper file at the root
level that runs the app (circlestories.py).

devenM -- 2021-10-27 21:57
Added wiki design doc for team Sports! which was split up in regrouping.
(design_wiki1.pdf)

devenM -- 2021-10-28 14:00
Added database building python. Configured for user and story databases.
Waiting on routes.py so that information can be processed into database.
(db_maker.py)

christopherL -- 2021-10-28 22:54
Basic refactoring of existing code for style and general consistency. Added a
general guidelines text file that will be added upon in the future for
reference.

christopherL -- 2021-10-28 23:45
Updated design doc: added more fields to the database organization section as
per our new app design (unique ids for everything). Added a database diagram.

christopherL -- 2021-10-29 08:14
Added requirements.txt for dependencies and updated README with launch codes.

naomiN -- 2021-10-29 08:23
Added HTML templates for login and logged in homepage.

christopherL -- 2021-10-29 08:27
Added routing for existing HTML templates.

yusufE -- 2021-10-31 06:41
Added all of my work from 2021-10-27 until now, including:
- StoryDB class to interface with a given SQLite database
- Story DAO that represents a particular row of the stories table
- Tests to ensure that creating new stories & adding blocks works
A lot of the current design is still subject to change.

devenM -- 2021-11-01 08:22
Created login and register html pages. Still tweaking with routing and connecting to db. 
(register.html and login.html)

yusufE -- 2021-11-01 08:39
Fixed story & block random ids by storing as hex
Fixed updating values for a Story DAO
Started append.html template for adding to stories

devenM -- 2021-11-01 13:44
Fixed login and register pages to display username, password, and email prompts. 
Need to import session to track user cookies
(register.html and login.html)

christopherL -- 2021-11-02 14:14
Connected all of the existing authentication code and set up authentication
routes. Previous db_maker.py is now incorporated into auth.py. We can now
create a new user, log in, stay logged in (with session) and have a different
homepage based on whether the user is logged in or not. Basic validation for
the registration form was implemented (no empty entries, email must be an email,
password and check password must match, username/email must be unique). We
likely should add (1) message flashing to let the user know that registration
worked and (2) PASSWORD HASHING because it's very insecure right now.

christopherL -- 2021-11-02 20:30
Added some basic QA and linting. I chose to use pylint for now, though it's a
little oversensitive so we'll see. Added a .pylintrc and updated
requirements.txt accordingly. In response to some of the linting errors, I did
some basic refactoring as well.

devenM -- 2021-11-03 08:34
Added append and view front end pages. Routed append to main site. Allowing
user to add to most recent block and view the entire creation on another page.
Using story database  block ID's to link entire stories. 

christopherL -- 2021-11-03 09:29
Added a method to get a user ID from a username.

devenM -- 2021-11-03 13:13
Edited routes to include append and view html files. Added view html files to view
completed stories and linked homepages and external sites to travel website. Need 
to link storydb and routes py to keep track of last_block and stories.
